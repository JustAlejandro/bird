2. Compile and Run using the exact same command as the code base
3. No special instructions
4. Extra credit:
We implemented collision detection with bounding spheres.
To run total inelastic collision, run with the "inelastic enabled" box checked.
To run total elastic collision, run with the "elastic enabled" box checked.
The collision simulation we implemented only features total inelastic or elastic collisions.
When both inelastic and elastic enabled boxes are checked, elastic overrides inelastic.
5. 6. All the specs are fulfilled as expected
